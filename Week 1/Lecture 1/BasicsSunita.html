        <h1>GranMorgu in Suriname: An Oil Project in Line with TotalEnergies’ Transition Strategy</h1>
        <h2>Located 150 kilometers off the coast of Suriname, GranMorgu is a deep offshore oil project operated by TotalEnergies. <br>GranMorgu is perfectly illustrative of our transition strategy: for its economic and social impact on this South American country, and for the efforts we are making to minimize its greenhouse gas emissions.</h2>
        <p>The GranMorgu project aims to develop resources on block 58, located around 150 kilometers off the Surinamese coast. Specifically, the Sapakara and Krabdagu fields, which contain recoverable reserves estimated at nearly 760 million barrels.

        The GranMorgu project’s floating production, storage and offloading unit (FPSO), with a capacity of 220,000 barrels per day, is based on the design principles of tried-and-tested units in Guyana in the same type of environment. The FPSO has been designed to allow the future connection of satellite fields to extend the duration of its production plateau. Production start-up is expected in 2028.</p>

        <h1>A major project for Suriname’s economy</h1>
        <p>Suriname is a coastal country in northeastern South America, neighboring Guyana, French Guiana and Brazil, with a population of 600,000 and a GDP of 3 to 4 billion(1). With a total investment of $10.5 billion, the GranMorgu project is of vital importance to the country. A significant proportion of the investments will be made locally, contributing to local employment and economic development in Suriname.

        Paramaribo, the country's capital, will be the main center for administrative, operations support and logistics activities. Local companies will contribute to logistics, well maintenance of the installations, as well as subsea and FPSO operations. In all, between $1bn and $1.5bn is expected to be invested in local content, creating over 6,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs in Suriname.</p>

        <h1>Why “GranMorgu”?</h1>
        <p>In Sranan Tongo, the local language of Suriname, “GranMorgu” has a double meaning. Firstly, it refers to the goliath grouper, a fish found in the country’s coastal waters that symbolizes strength and longevity, and is said by some South American and Caribbean Amerindian communities to possess supernatural powers. GranMorgu also means “a great morning” or “a new dawn”. By naming this project “GranMorgu”, we are reiterating our responsibility towards Suriname and its environment as an operator in the Oil & Gas sector, while symbolizing the new start the project represents for the country’s economy.</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>Producing low-emission oil: a challenge taken up by TotalEnergies in Suriname</h1>
        <p>The GranMorgu project is fully in line with our strategy of developing low-emission, low-cost Oil & Gas projects, since it has a scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity of less than 16 kg CO2e/boe. To achieve this result, we have used the best available technologies to minimize greenhouse gas emissions, including:

        an all-electric FPSO, with no routine flaring and including the ability to reinject all associated gas into the tanks;
        optimized energy consumption thanks to a waste heat recovery unit and a seawater cooling system; and
        a permanent system for detecting and measuring methane emissions through the installation of a network of sensors.</p>
